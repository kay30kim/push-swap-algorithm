# push-swap-algorithm

## Description:
The "push_swap" program is a sorting algorithm implementation that takes a stack of integers as input and outputs the smallest list of instructions required to sort the stack. The primary goal is to have the smallest number at the top of the stack. The program uses quicksort with two deques, separating elements based on a pivot value. Additionally, mergesort is employed to determine the pivot.

## Challenge
Sort a random list of integers using the smallest number of moves, 2 deques and a limited set of operations. <br />

You start with two empty deques: **a** and **b**. You are given a random list of integers via command line arguments.
<br />

Only these moves are allowed:
- `sa` : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `sb` : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `ss` : `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- `pa` : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
- `pb` : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
- `ra` : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
- `rb` : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rr` : `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- `rra` : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrb` : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrr` : `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.
<br />

At the end, **stack b** must empty empty and all integers must be in **stack a**, sorted in ascending order. <br />

## The Project
Create two programs: ```checker``` and ```push_swap```. <br />

The ```checker``` program reads a random list of integers from the stdin, stores them, and checks to see
if they are sorted. <br />
The ```push_swap``` program calculates the moves to sort the integers – *pushing, popping, swapping* and *rotating* 
them between **stack a** and **stack b** – and displays those directions on the stdout. <br />

You can pipe ```push_swap``` into ```checker```, and ```checker``` will verify that ```push_swap```'s instructions were successful. 
<br />

Both programs must mandatorily parse input for errors, including empty strings, no parameters, 
non-numeric parameters, duplicates, and invalid/non-existent instructions.

**Push_Swap** must conform to the [42 Norm](). <br />
Using normal ```libc``` functions is strictly forbidden. Students are however, allowed to use: ```write```, ```read```, ```malloc```, ```free```, ```exit```. 
It must not have any memory leaks. Errors must be handled carefully. <br />
In no way can it quit in an unexpected manner (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).

## Implementation Details:
- The program utilizes quicksort with two deques, sending elements to a different deque if they are smaller than the pivot and to the back of the current deque if they are larger.
- Mergesort is employed to find the pivot efficiently.
